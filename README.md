# Retro MineSweeper Game using Recursion Algorithm and Object Oriented Programming

### Built with  React, TypeScript, Styled Components, & CSS Grid

Created Retro 1980's style Minesweeper game, complete with retro font, layout,
and sounds.

### CSS Grid plus Styled Components for a Dyanamic Grid

Allowing players to dynamically change the grid dimension was tricky.
Cleanest approach I discovered was passing props through Styled Components
for the grid dimensions.
